<h1>Methods</h1>

<p>In order to further investigate our question we began with raw data provided by the Multnomah County Health Department which included all mortalities within the county from 2006 to 2023. We then limited our data set to only cancer-related deaths and loaded in our ICD codes in order to match each code with its corresponding disease site. Once each cancer mortality was matched with its disease site, we were able to accumulate the counts by disease site and year. This enabled us to pinpoint the top cancers we would focus on. Since the top 3 cancers varied by year we decided to choose all 5 that show up at least once within the top 3: "Lung", "Pancreas", "Breast", "Colon", and "Lymphatic or Blood."</p>

<p>After successfully narrowing our data down to these specific cancer types, we identified our variable of concern "ddeduc" and narrowed the time to 10 years (2014-2023). For our final clean-up steps we removed male cases of breast cancer (since an overwhelming amount are female) and removed "other" or "NaN" values for "ddeduc."</p>

<p>Now that we had our aggregated data, we were then able to move everything off of our secure Rstudio server and combine our data with TidyCensus. This incorporation of population data enabled us to look at rates instead of raw counts of mortality in the county. After loading in our TidyCensus data and identifying our variable of concern: B15002, "Sex by Educational Attainment", we pulled in Multnomah county population data from 2014-2023 (by sex in order to account for the fact that all of our Breast cancer cases are female). Since TidyCensus had several more education levels than our aggregated data, we had to then bin each category so we were able to match up our population counts with our education levels in our aggregated data. Finally, we calculated our new rate variable (per 100k people) by finding the percentage of each mortality count over the population and then multiplying by 100000. This gives us a better idea of the actual rate of each cancer mortality by education level relative to the total population.</p>

<p>Once we successfully cleaned up our data and calculated the rates using TidyCensus, we were finally able to begin our analysis. We primarily focused on using ggplot to create data visualizations so that we could better see the relationships among our many variables. Since our data was stratified by so many variables (education, year, and disease site) we created a combination of line graphs and histograms to better visualize these relationships. While many visualizations were fairly straightforward in displaying our cumulative rates and rates over time, we conducted one statistical analysis in order to analyze the correlation between education level and mortality rate. After using ggplot to graph these lines of best fit, we used R's tools to identify the R\^2 value in order to further understand the strength of the correlation.</p>
