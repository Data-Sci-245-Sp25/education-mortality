<p>This is our project.</p>
<p>We are looking at the top 3 types of cancer by the year.</p>
<p>We are curious about the connection between cancer mortality and education status.</p>
<p>We are using Multnomah County datasets.</p>
<p>We are also combining that data with tinycenus information based off of tracts to find age adjsuted rates.<p/>
