<h1>Background</h1>
<h2>Cancer as a Leading Cause of Death</h2>
<p>Cancer is one of the leading mortality causes worldwide. According to
the World Health Organization, cancer was responsible for
approximately 10 million deaths in 2020 [WHO](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer).
There are myriad risk factors for cancer, including genetic
predisposition, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and access to healthcare services. However, there is increasing evidence that
socioeconomic factors, such as education, play a significant role in
both cancer prevention and survival.</p>
<h2>The Role of Education in Health Outcomes</h2>
<p>Education is often considered a key determinant of health outcomes.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals with higher levels
of education tend to have better health outcomes, including lower
mortality rates. This could be attributed to several factors</p>
-   Health Literacy
    -   Individuals with higher education levels are more likely to
        understand medical information, engage in preventative health
        behaviors, and make informed decisions about treatment options.
-   Access to Healthcare
    -   Educated individuals often have greater access to healthcare
        services, including cancer prevention programs, screenings,
        early diagnosis, and treatments.

-   Lifestyle Factors
    -   Knowledge is power. Education influences lifestyle choices, such
        as diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption, all of
        which are linked to cancer risk.
<h2>Cancer Mortality Rates and Socioeconomic Status (SES)</h2>
<p>SES includes education level, income, and occupation (all of which
are intrinsically related to one-another), and has long been associated
with cancer mortality rates. Studies have shown that individuals in
lower SES groups tend to experience higher cancer mortality rates. This
could be attributed to factors such as</p>
-   Delayed diagnosis and Treatment
    -   Lower educational attainment may correlate with a lack of
        awareness about cancer symptoms or the importance of early
        detection, leading to later-stage diagnoses and poorer outcomes.
-   Health Behaviors
    -   People with lower education levels may be less likely to engage
        in preventive behaviors, such as cancer screening or avoiding
        risk factors (e.g., smoking).
-   Environmental Exposures
    -   Lower-income populations may also face greater exposure to
        environmental risk factors, such as pollution or hazardous
        working conditions, which are linked to certain types of cancer.
<h2>Educational Inequalities in Cancer Mortality</h2>
<p>The relationship between education and cancer mortality rates is
complex and multifaceted. Some studies have found that people with
higher levels of education are not only less likely to develop cancer
but also more likely to survive cancer if diagnosed. Conversely, lower
educational attainment often correlates with higher cancer mortality
rates, even after controlling for factors like age, sex, and
geographical location.</p>
<p>While the link between education and cancer mortality has been widely studied, it remains important to examine how education-related
disparities can be addressed to reduce cancer mortality, particularly in underserved or marginalized populations. Public health efforts that
increase education about cancer prevention, promote early screening, and ensure equitable access to healthcare could significantly lower
cancer-related deaths.</p>

<h2>Previous Research</h2>
<p>Research indicates a significant inverse relationship between
educational attainment and cancer mortality rates in the United States. Individuals with lower levels of education experience higher cancer mortality rates compared to those with higher education levels.</p>

<p>A study analyzing data from 8.2 million death certificates between
1989 and 2018 found that individuals with less than a high school
diploma had higher cancer mortality rates than their more educated
counterparts. This disparity was more pronounced among non-Hispanic
white males and females compared to non-Hispanic black individuals. The study also noted that while cancer mortality rates have declined
overall, the reduction was less significant among individuals with lower educational attainment, leading to a widening mortality gap over
time [BMC] (https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08633-7).</p>

<p>Lung cancer deaths contribute significantly to educational
disparities in cancer mortality, accounting for over half (53%) of the
relative difference in the United States. Efforts to reduce smoking,
which is more prevalent among individuals with lower education levels,
are essential in addressing this disparity. [Research Gate] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353142315_Leading_cancers_contributing_to_educational_disparities_in_cancer_mortality_in_the_US_2017)</p>

<p>Furthermore, individuals with lower educational attainment often have higher allostatic load—a measure of cumulative physiological
stress—which has been associated with a more than fourfold increase in
cancer mortality risk compared to those with lower allostatic load and
higher education levels [JAMA] (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827623).</p>

<p><small>Allostatic Load, Educational Attainment, and Risk of Cancer
Mortality Among US Men</small></p>

<p>A study found that lower educational attainment is linked to higher
cancer mortality among Black and White adults in the U.S. Individuals
without a high school diploma had a significantly increased risk of
dying from cancer. Social determinants of health, such as income and
healthcare access, partially explained this link, while health behaviors like smoking and physical activity did not. Addressing socioeconomic
disparities could help reduce cancer mortality rates among less-educated individuals [NIH] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37954012/).</p>

<p>The relationship between education and cancer mortality underscores the crucial role that socioeconomic factors play in shaping health outcomes. Higher levels of education are linked to better health literacy, improved access to healthcare, and healthier lifestyle choices, all of which contribute to reduced cancer risk and improved survival rates. Conversely, lower educational attainment correlates with higher cancer mortality, driven by factors such as delayed diagnosis, poorer health behaviors, and greater exposure to environmental risk factors. Addressing educational inequalities, through targeted public health campaigns and improved access to cancer prevention and treatment, is essential in reducing the global cancer burden. By focusing on education and access, we can significantly reduce the disparities in cancer outcomes and work towards a more equitable and healthier society.</p>
