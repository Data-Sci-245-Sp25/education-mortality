<p> First we can look more generally at the mortality rates of each cancer type over the past 10 years. Here we see that lung cancer is significantly more prominent than all of the other cancers, with breast cancer close behind and the last 3 further below. There also seems to be some fluctuation over time, with a spike in mortality rates for most cancer types in 2015, 2020, and 2022 and a dip in 2021.</p>

<p>Next, we can look at the same line plot, now stratified education level. Similarly to above, we see a prominent difference in lung cancer mortality rates compared to all other cancer types. Looking at the education level trends, we see many of the orange lines higher up, indicating higher mortality rates for lower education levels.</p>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=10}

ggplot(data=educCancerRates, mapping=aes(x=ddodyear, y=rate_per_100k, color=ddeduc))+ geom_point() +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~category) + labs(title= "Cancer Mortality Rates by Education Over Time", x="Year", y="Mortality Rate Per 100k People") +
  theme_minimal() + labs(color = "Education Level") + scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "#D35400",  # Burnt orange
    "#C77938",  # Copper
    "#B4985C",  # Khaki brown
    "#9FA58D",  # Desaturated olive
    "#7E94A9",  # Dusty blue
    "#5D7EB2",  # Blue-gray
    "#3F5FA3",  # Rich blue
    "#2C3E50"   # Navy   
  ), labels=c("8th Grade or Less", "Some HS (No Degree)", "HS Diploma/GED", "Some College (No Degree)",
                      "Associates", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "Doctorate/Professional")) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      hjust = 0.5,     # 0 = left, 0.5 = center, 1 = right
      size = 15,       # Font size
      face = "bold",    # Optional: makes it bold
      family = "Lato"
    )
  )
```
<p>For our next graph, we removed our time variable to look more closely at the relationship between cancer type and education level. Here it's very apparent that the education level with the highest mortality rate is "HS Diploma/GED" for all cancer types. Each cancer type, while at different rates, resembles a similar distribution where most lower education levels have higher mortality rates.</p>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
educCancerRatesOverall$ddeduc <- as.factor(educCancerRatesOverall$ddeduc)
ggplot(data=educCancerRatesOverall, mapping=aes(x=ddeduc, y = total_death_rate, fill=ddeduc)) +
  geom_col() + facet_wrap(~category, nrow=1) + labs(title= "Cancer Mortality Rates by Education", x="Education Level", y="Mortality Rate per 100k People") +
  theme_minimal() + labs(color = "Education Level") + scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "#D35400",  # Burnt orange
    "#C77938",  # Copper
    "#B4985C",  # Khaki brown
    "#9FA58D",  # Desaturated olive
    "#7E94A9",  # Dusty blue
    "#5D7EB2",  # Blue-gray
    "#3F5FA3",  # Rich blue
    "#2C3E50"   # Navy  
  ), labels=c("1: 8th Grade or Less", "2: Some HS (No Degree)", "3: HS Diploma/GED", "4: Some College (No Degree)",
              "5: Associates", "6: Bachelor's", "7: Master's", "8: Doctorate/Professional")) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      hjust = 0.5,     # 0 = left, 0.5 = center, 1 = right
      size = 15,       # Font size
      face = "bold",    # Optional: makes it bold
      family = "Lato"
    )
  )
```
<p>By further simplifying our graph and looking at total mortality rates by education level, we once again see a prominent spike in mortality rates for those with their high school diploma or GED. Our trend of higher mortality rates for lower education levels remains consistent. This makes sense since higher education levels indicate higher income and an ability to both diagnose and treat cancer. For education levels below high school diploma having lower rates than high school diploma, this is likely due to an inability to diagnose their cancer in the first place as a result of lower income. </p>

      face = "bold",    # Optional: makes it bold
      family = "Lato"
    )
  ) # level 3 has the most death rates
```
<p>Looking at a similar graph but in line-chart form we can better visualize this spike in mortality for the high school diploma/GED education level. We also see that there's a dip in lung cancer mortality at higher education levels to a point where it runs below breast cancer. Lung cancer, with higher mortalities overall, presents a much higher drop in mortality rates at higher education levels relative to the other cancer types.</p>

<p>Lastly, we decided to look at the correlation between education level and mortality rate. Here we see a moderately negative correlation, with a R^2 value of 0.546. While not super strong, we indeed see correlation between higher education levels leading to lower mortality rates. </p>
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data=educRatesOverall, mapping=aes(x=ddeduc, y=total_death_rate))+
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + labs(title="Education Level vs Cancer Mortality Rate", x="Education Level", y="Mortality Rate per 100k People")+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      hjust = 0.5,     # 0 = left, 0.5 = center, 1 = right
      size = 15,       # Font size
      face = "bold",    # Optional: makes it bold
      family = "Lato"
    ))
# p-value: .03624 (significant at alpha=5%)
# R^2: 0.546, moderately strong correlation
```
<p>Further looking at this correlation stratified by cancer type, we see that lung cancer has a much stronger correlation (R^2=.601) compared to the other cancer types. Additionally, breast cancer has a notably lower correlation (R^2=.1195). Ultimately, we see that lung cancer mortality rates are more affected by education level than breast cancer mortality rates. </p>
