<h1>Conclusion</h1>
We have, of course not found novel information through this study. We have seen time and time again how negative health outcomes are more prevalent in people of lower SES categories and more marginalized groups. But, this does not mean this work is meaningless. By combining the work of all of our projects, we are able to identify how these patterns appear in OUR community. If we look at geography, we can note that those with lower SES tend to live in the Southwest region...
also remember that formal education is not an indicator of who someone is as a person or their worth. Also not a signal of intelligence.
