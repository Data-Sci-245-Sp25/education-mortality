<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this research highlights a clear relationship between education level and cancer mortality rates in Multnomah County, shining a light on the significant role education plays in health outcomes. Our analysis confirmed that individuals with lower levels of education, particularly those with only a high school diploma or GED, experience higher cancer mortality rates across various cancer types, including lung, breast, pancreas, colon, and lymphatic/blood cancers. This trend suggests that lower education levels are associated with a combination of delayed diagnoses, poorer access to healthcare, and lifestyle factors that contribute to worse cancer outcomes.</p>
<p>The correlation between education level and cancer mortality rates was evident, with a moderately negative relationship found overall, and a particularly strong correlation for lung cancer mortality. These findings suggest that higher education levels, often linked to better health literacy, greater access to healthcare, and healthier lifestyle choices, contribute to improved survival rates and lower mortality risk. Conversely, individuals with lower education levels may face barriers to early diagnosis, treatment, and health management, exacerbating cancer-related disparities.</p>
<p>Addressing these educational inequalities through public health interventions and policies that promote cancer prevention, early screening, and equitable healthcare access is crucial. By focusing on education as a key determinant of health, it is possible to reduce the cancer burden and improve survival outcomes, particularly for underserved populations in our community. Moving forward, this research can inform targeted health initiatives aimed at bridging the educational divide and ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their educational background, have equal opportunities to prevent, detect, and survive cancer.</p>
