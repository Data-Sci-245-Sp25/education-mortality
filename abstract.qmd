<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This study investigates the relationship between education level and cancer mortality rates in Multnomah County, aiming to understand how educational attainment influences cancer survival outcomes. Using mortality data from 2006 to 2023 provided by the Multnomah County Health Department, we analyzed cancer-related deaths across different education levels. Our findings reveal that individuals with lower education levels, particularly those with a high school diploma or GED, experience significantly higher cancer mortality rates, with lung cancer showing the most pronounced disparity. The data also demonstrates a moderately negative correlation between education level and cancer mortality, indicating that higher education is associated with lower mortality rates. This correlation is most evident in lung cancer, which shows a stronger relationship with education than other cancer types, such as breast cancer.</p>
<p>The results highlight the critical role that education plays in shaping cancer outcomes, suggesting that lower education levels are linked to factors such as delayed diagnosis, limited access to healthcare, and higher engagement in risk behaviors, all of which contribute to poorer survival rates. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing educational disparities through public health initiatives aimed at improving health literacy, access to cancer screenings, and treatment, particularly for marginalized and underserved communities. By focusing on education as a determinant of health, we can work toward reducing cancer mortality and improving health equity in Multnomah County.</p>
