<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>This research aims to explore the relationship between education level and cancer mortality rates. By analyzing data on educational attainment and cancer mortality in Multnomah County, we seek to understand how formal education influences cancer survival outcomes. Our goal is to provide valuable insights that will support the Multnomah County Health Department’s epidemiology team in better addressing the health needs of our community.</p>
<p>This project is part of our DSCI 245 Applied Data Science Practicum class, where we collaborated with the Multnomah County Health Department to investigate cancer mortality and education levels. During the brainstorming phase of our project, we explored several research questions, such as “How does the mortality rate of various cancer types differ across occupations?” and “Does access to public transportation affect cancer mortality?” After careful consideration, our partners at the Health Department helped us select our final research question.</p>
<p>We chose to focus on education and cancer mortality because this area offers unique insights. Cancer survival is influenced by a range of factors, but examining education levels opens up important new avenues for understanding health disparities. If a relationship is found between education and cancer mortality, we can then investigate the underlying causes.</p>
<p>When a person has a higher education, that often relates to having the ability to critically interact with health information. It also implies a means to act on that new information, whether by finances, time allocation, or pure access to resources.Higher education often correlates with better health literacy, meaning individuals are more likely to understand medical information, engage in preventative behaviors, and make informed decisions about treatment. Additionally, higher education may provide the resources to act on that information, whether through financial means, time management, or access to healthcare services. Through this research, we hope to shed light on how education impacts cancer survival, with the hope of informing better health interventions and policies in our community.</p>
