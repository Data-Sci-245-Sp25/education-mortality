<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>As a part of our DSCI 245 Applied Data Science Practicum class, we worked in collaboration with the Multnomah County Health Department to exmaine the relationship between cancer mortality rates and education levels.
This project idea came from a couple of brainstorming sessions where the class discussed what research questions would be of interest for our investigations into cancer mortality in Multnomah County. Many ideas were floated, such as "How does mortality of varying cancer types differ across occupations?" and "Does access to public transportation have an effect on mortality of varying cancer types?" The final selection of our topic was decided by our partners at the Health Department.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in this topic for a myriad reasons. We know that there are many factors that go into survival rates, especially when dealing with chronic illness. Looking through the lens of education is a unique perspective as it opens up avenues to asking further questions. If we determine that there exists a relationship between highest education levels attained, we then ask <em>why that is so</em>.</p>
<p>When a person has a higher education, that often relates to having the ability to critically interact with health information. It also implies a means to act on that new information, whether by finances, time allocation, or pure access to resources.</p>
