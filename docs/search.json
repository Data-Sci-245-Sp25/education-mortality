    "text": "Purpose\n\n\nAs a part of our DSCI 245 Applied Data Science Practicum class, we worked in collaboration with the Multnomah County Health Department to exmaine the relationship between cancer mortality rates and education levels. This project idea came from a couple of brainstorming sessions where the class discussed what research questions would be of interest for our investigations into cancer mortality in Multnomah County. Many ideas were floated, such as “How does mortality of varying cancer types differ across occupations?” and “Does access to public transportation have an effect on mortality of varying cancer types?” The final selection of our topic was decided by our partners at the Health Department.\n\n\nWe were particularly interested in this topic for a myriad reasons. We know that there are many factors that go into survival rates, especially when dealing with chronic illness. Looking through the lens of education is a unique perspective as it opens up avenues to asking further questions. If we determine that there exists a relationship between highest education levels attained, we then ask why that is so.\n\n\nWhen a person has a higher education, that often relates to having the ability to critically interact with health information. It also implies a means to act on that new information, whether by finances, time allocation, or pure access to resources.",

    "text": "Background\n\n\nResearch indicates a significant inverse relationship between educational attainment and cancer mortality rates in the United States. Individuals with lower levels of education experience higher cancer mortality rates compared to those with higher education levels.\n\n\nA study analyzing data from 8.2 million death certificates between 1989 and 2018 found that individuals with less than a high school diploma had higher cancer mortality rates than their more educated counterparts. This disparity was more pronounced among non-Hispanic white males and females compared to non-Hispanic black individuals. The study also noted that while cancer mortality rates have declined overall, the reduction was less significant among individuals with lower educational attainment, leading to a widening mortality gap over time.\n\n\nThe role of education on Cancer amenable mortality among non-Hispanic blacks & non-Hispanic whites in the United States (1989–2018) \n\n\nLung cancer deaths contribute significantly to educational disparities in cancer mortality, accounting for over half (53%) of the relative difference in the United States. Efforts to reduce smoking, which is more prevalent among individuals with lower education levels, are essential in addressing this disparity.\n\n\nLeading cancers contributing to educational disparities in cancer mortality in the US, 2017 \n\n\nFurthermore, individuals with lower educational attainment often have higher allostatic load—a measure of cumulative physiological stress—which has been associated with a more than fourfold increase in cancer mortality risk compared to those with lower allostatic load and higher education levels.\n\n\nAllostatic Load, Educational Attainment, and Risk of Cancer Mortality Among US Men\n\n\nA study found that lower educational attainment is linked to higher cancer mortality among Black and White adults in the U.S. Individuals without a high school diploma had a significantly increased risk of dying from cancer. Social determinants of health, such as income and healthcare access, partially explained this link, while health behaviors like smoking and physical activity did not. Addressing socioeconomic disparities could help reduce cancer mortality rates among less-educated individuals.\n\n\nAssociation of educational attainment with cancer mortality in a national cohort study of black and white adults: A mediation analysis",
