    "text": "Results\n\n\nFirst we can look more generally at the mortality rates of each cancer type over the past 10 years. Here we see that lung cancer is significantly more prominent than all of the other cancers, with breast cancer close behind and the last 3 further below. There also seems to be some fluctuation over time, with a spike in mortality rates for most cancer types in 2015, 2020, and 2022 and a dip in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can look at the same line plot, now stratified education level. Similarly to above, we see a prominent difference in lung cancer mortality rates compared to all other cancer types. Looking at the education level trends, we see many of the orange lines higher up, indicating higher mortality rates for lower education levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our next graph, we removed our time variable to look more closely at the relationship between cancer type and education level. Here it’s very apparent that the education level with the highest mortality rate is “HS Diploma/GED” for all cancer types. Each cancer type, while at different rates, resembles a similar distribution where most lower education levels have higher mortality rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy further simplifying our graph and looking at total mortality rates by education level, we once again see a prominent spike in mortality rates for those with their high school diploma or GED. Our trend of higher mortality rates for lower education levels remains consistent. This makes sense since higher education levels indicate higher income and an ability to both diagnose and treat cancer. For education levels below high school diploma having lower rates than high school diploma, this is likely due to an inability to diagnose their cancer in the first place as a result of lower income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at a similar graph but in line-chart form we can better visualize this spike in mortality for the high school diploma/GED education level. We also see that there’s a dip in lung cancer mortality at higher education levels to a point where it runs below breast cancer. Lung cancer, with higher mortalities overall, presents a much higher drop in mortality rates at higher education levels relative to the other cancer types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we decided to look at the correlation between education level and mortality rate. Here we see a moderately negative correlation, with a R^2 value of 0.546. While not super strong, we indeed see correlation between higher education levels leading to lower mortality rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther looking at this correlation stratified by cancer type, we see that lung cancer has a much stronger correlation (R^2=.601) compared to the other cancer types. Additionally, breast cancer has a notably lower correlation (R^2=.1195). Ultimately, we see that lung cancer mortality rates are more affected by education level than breast cancer mortality rates.",

    "text": "Purpose\n\n\nThis research aims to explore the relationship between education level and cancer mortality rates. By analyzing data on educational attainment and cancer mortality in Multnomah County, we seek to understand how formal education influences cancer survival outcomes. Our goal is to provide valuable insights that will support the Multnomah County Health Department’s epidemiology team in better addressing the health needs of our community.\n\n\nThis project is part of our DSCI 245 Applied Data Science Practicum class, where we collaborated with the Multnomah County Health Department to investigate cancer mortality and education levels. During the brainstorming phase of our project, we explored several research questions, such as “How does the mortality rate of various cancer types differ across occupations?” and “Does access to public transportation affect cancer mortality?” After careful consideration, our partners at the Health Department helped us select our final research question.\n\n\nWe chose to focus on education and cancer mortality because this area offers unique insights. Cancer survival is influenced by a range of factors, but examining education levels opens up important new avenues for understanding health disparities. If a relationship is found between education and cancer mortality, we can then investigate the underlying causes.\n\n\nWhen a person has a higher education, that often relates to having the ability to critically interact with health information. It also implies a means to act on that new information, whether by finances, time allocation, or pure access to resources.Higher education often correlates with better health literacy, meaning individuals are more likely to understand medical information, engage in preventative behaviors, and make informed decisions about treatment. Additionally, higher education may provide the resources to act on that information, whether through financial means, time management, or access to healthcare services. Through this research, we hope to shed light on how education impacts cancer survival, with the hope of informing better health interventions and policies in our community.",

    "text": "Background\n\n\nCancer as a Leading Cause of Death\n\n\nCancer is one of the leading mortality causes worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, cancer was responsible for approximately 10 million deaths in 2020 WHO. There are myriad risk factors for cancer, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and access to healthcare services. However, there is increasing evidence that socioeconomic factors, such as education, play a significant role in both cancer prevention and survival.\n\n\nThe Role of Education in Health Outcomes\n\n\nEducation is often considered a key determinant of health outcomes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of education tend to have better health outcomes, including lower mortality rates. This could be attributed to several factors\n\n\nHealth Literacy\n\nIndividuals with higher education levels are more likely to understand medical information, engage in preventative health behaviors, and make informed decisions about treatment options.\n\nAccess to Healthcare\n\nEducated individuals often have greater access to healthcare services, including cancer prevention programs, screenings, early diagnosis, and treatments.\n\nLifestyle Factors\n\nKnowledge is power. Education influences lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption, all of which are linked to cancer risk.\n\nCancer Mortality Rates and Socioeconomic Status (SES)\n\n\nSES includes education level, income, and occupation (all of which are intrinsically related to one-another), and has long been associated with cancer mortality rates. Studies have shown that individuals in lower SES groups tend to experience higher cancer mortality rates. This could be attributed to factors such as\n\n\nDelayed diagnosis and Treatment\n\nLower educational attainment may correlate with a lack of awareness about cancer symptoms or the importance of early detection, leading to later-stage diagnoses and poorer outcomes.\n\nHealth Behaviors\n\nPeople with lower education levels may be less likely to engage in preventive behaviors, such as cancer screening or avoiding risk factors (e.g., smoking).\n\nEnvironmental Exposures\n\nLower-income populations may also face greater exposure to environmental risk factors, such as pollution or hazardous working conditions, which are linked to certain types of cancer.\n\nEducational Inequalities in Cancer Mortality\n\n\nThe relationship between education and cancer mortality rates is complex and multifaceted. Some studies have found that people with higher levels of education are not only less likely to develop cancer but also more likely to survive cancer if diagnosed. Conversely, lower educational attainment often correlates with higher cancer mortality rates, even after controlling for factors like age, sex, and geographical location.\n\n\nWhile the link between education and cancer mortality has been widely studied, it remains important to examine how education-related disparities can be addressed to reduce cancer mortality, particularly in underserved or marginalized populations. Public health efforts that increase education about cancer prevention, promote early screening, and ensure equitable access to healthcare could significantly lower cancer-related deaths.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Research\n\n\nResearch indicates a significant inverse relationship between educational attainment and cancer mortality rates in the United States. Individuals with lower levels of education experience higher cancer mortality rates compared to those with higher education levels.\n\n\nA study analyzing data from 8.2 million death certificates between 1989 and 2018 found that individuals with less than a high school diploma had higher cancer mortality rates than their more educated counterparts. This disparity was more pronounced among non-Hispanic white males and females compared to non-Hispanic black individuals. The study also noted that while cancer mortality rates have declined overall, the reduction was less significant among individuals with lower educational attainment, leading to a widening mortality gap over time BMC.\n\n\nRegarding specific cancer sites, lung cancer deaths contribute significantly to educational disparities in cancer mortality, accounting for over half (53%) of the relative difference in the United States. Efforts to reduce smoking, which is more prevalent among individuals with lower education levels, are essential in addressing this disparity. Research Gate\n\n\nFurthermore, individuals with lower educational attainment often have higher allostatic load—a measure of cumulative physiological stress—which has been associated with a more than fourfold increase in cancer mortality risk compared to those with lower allostatic load and higher education levels JAMA.\n\n\nAnother study found that lower educational attainment is linked to higher cancer mortality among Black and White adults in the U.S. Individuals without a high school diploma had a significantly increased risk of dying from cancer. Social determinants of health, such as income and healthcare access, partially explained this link, while health behaviors like smoking and physical activity did not. Addressing socioeconomic disparities could help reduce cancer mortality rates among less-educated individuals NIH.\n\n\nThe relationship between education and cancer mortality underscores the crucial role that socioeconomic factors play in shaping health outcomes. Higher levels of education are linked to better health literacy, improved access to healthcare, and healthier lifestyle choices, all of which contribute to reduced cancer risk and improved survival rates. Conversely, lower educational attainment correlates with higher cancer mortality, driven by factors such as delayed diagnosis, poorer health behaviors, and greater exposure to environmental risk factors. Addressing educational inequalities, through targeted public health campaigns and improved access to cancer prevention and treatment, is essential in reducing the global cancer burden. By focusing on education and access, we can significantly reduce the disparities in cancer outcomes and work towards a more equitable and healthier society.",

    "text": "Methods\n\n\nIn order to further investigate our question we began with raw data provided by the Multnomah County Health Department which included all mortalities within the county from 2006 to 2023. We then limited our data set to only cancer-related deaths and loaded in our ICD codes in order to match each code with its corresponding disease site. Once each cancer mortality was matched with its disease site, we were able to accumulate the counts by disease site and year. This enabled us to pinpoint the top cancers we would focus on. Since the top 3 cancers varied by year we decided to choose all 5 that show up at least once within the top 3: “Lung”, “Pancreas”, “Breast”, “Colon”, and “Lymphatic or Blood.”\n\n\nAfter successfully narrowing our data down to these specific cancer types, we identified our variable of concern “ddeduc” and narrowed the time to 10 years (2014-2023). For our final clean-up steps we removed male cases of breast cancer (since an overwhelming amount are female) and removed “other” or “NaN” values for “ddeduc.”\n\n\nNow that we had our aggregated data, we were then able to move everything off of our secure Rstudio server and combine our data with TidyCensus. This incorporation of population data enabled us to look at rates instead of raw counts of mortality in the county. After loading in our TidyCensus data and identifying our variable of concern: B15002, “Sex by Educational Attainment”, we pulled in Multnomah county population data from 2014-2023 (by sex in order to account for the fact that all of our Breast cancer cases are female). Since TidyCensus had several more education levels than our aggregated data, we had to then bin each category so we were able to match up our population counts with our education levels in our aggregated data. Finally, we calculated our new rate variable (per 100k people) by finding the percentage of each mortality count over the population and then multiplying by 100000. This gives us a better idea of the actual rate of each cancer mortality by education level relative to the total population.\n\n\nOnce we successfully cleaned up our data and calculated the rates using TidyCensus, we were finally able to begin our analysis. We primarily focused on using ggplot to create data visualizations so that we could better see the relationships among our many variables. Since our data was stratified by so many variables (education, year, and disease site) we created a combination of line graphs and histograms to better visualize these relationships. While many visualizations were fairly straightforward in displaying our cumulative rates and rates over time, we conducted one statistical analysis in order to analyze the correlation between education level and mortality rate. After using ggplot to graph these lines of best fit, we used R’s tools to identify the R^2 value in order to further understand the strength of the correlation.",

We have seen time and time again how negative health outcomes are more prevalent in people of lower SES categories and more marginalized groups. But, this does not mean this work is meaningless. By combining the work of all of our projects, we are able to identify how these patterns appear in OUR community. If we look at geography, we can note that those with lower SES tend to live in the Southwest region… also remember that formal education is not an indicator of who someone is as a person or their worth. Also not a signal of intelligence.",
